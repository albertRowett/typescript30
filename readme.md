# TypeScript30

My solutions to the JavaScript30 challenge, but written in TypeScript.

## Introduction

[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) is a JavaScript tutorial series, created by [@wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos), that focuses on improving JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on projects that don't rely on any frameworks or libraries.

I used these tutorials as a way to discover new JavaScript features and practice building more complex, interactive projects. Through them, I've learnt a range of useful JavaScript techniques, including handling a wide variety of browser events, using template literals for cleaner string interpolation and array/object destructuring.

I also used this project as an opportunity to familiarise myself with TypeScript, writing my solutions in TypeScript (and compiling to JavaScript) to get comfortable with its syntax and type system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`git clone https://github.com/albertRowett/typescript30.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cd typescript30`

3. Install dependencies (only necessary if you want to compile TypeScript):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install`

4. Open the projects:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view a project, open its `index.html` file (found in the `src` directory) in a browser or use a local development server.
